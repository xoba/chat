The included resource in this document is a Zen story titled "Finding
a Diamond on a Muddy Road" sourced from
https://ashidakim.com/zenkoans/2findingadiamond.html. The story is
about Gudo, the emperor's teacher, who helps a problematic man in
a village to understand the impermanence of life and the problems
his gambling and drinking habits are causing his family.

Notable quotes from the resource:

1. "Gudo was the emperor's teacher of his time. Nevertheless, he
used to travel alone as a wandering mendicant."

2. "Observing that the entire family was depressed, Gudo asked what
was wrong."

3. "I will help him," said Gudo. "Here is some money. Get me a
gallon of fine wine and something good to eat. Then you may retire.
I will meditate before the shrine."

4. "Everything in this life is impermanent," he explained. "Life
is very brief. If you keep on gambling and drinking, you will have
no time left to accomplish anything else, and you will cause your
family to suffer too."

5. "Modern Zen teachings in Japan spring from the lineage of a
famous master who was the successor of Gudo. His name was Mu-nan,
the man who never turned back."

**> what's the moral of the story, or the conclusion?**

The moral of the story is about the impermanence of life and the
importance of using one's time wisely. It underlines the fact that
harmful habits not only affect the person indulging in them but
also their loved ones. The story also highlights the transformative
power of wisdom and guidance.

The conclusion of the story is that the man, deeply moved and
awakened by Gudo's teachings, decides to follow him for the rest
of his life, symbolizing his commitment to change. The text also
reveals that the man, known as Mu-nan, becomes a significant figure
in Zen teachings, showing that profound change and redemption are
possible.

**> what about leaving his wife behind?**

The story doesn't explicitly address what happens to the man's wife
after he decides to follow Gudo. However, it's possible to interpret
this in different ways.  One interpretation could be that by choosing
to follow Gudo and leave his old life behind, the man is indirectly
helping his family.  By ending his harmful habits of gambling and
drinking, he's no longer causing them pain and suffering.

However, another interpretation could focus on the man's decision
to abandon his family to follow Gudo as a form of escapism, avoiding
his responsibilities rather than facing them. The story doesn't
provide enough details to determine which interpretation is correct.
